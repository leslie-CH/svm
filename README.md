# On the Equivalence between Neural Network and Support Vector Machine
Codes for NeurIPS 2021 paper "[On the Equivalence between Neural Network and Support Vector Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06063.pdf)".



# Overview
In this paper, we prove the equivalence between neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM), specifically, the 
infinitely wide NN trained by soft margin loss and the standard soft margin SVM with NTK trained by subgradient descent. 
Our main theoretical results include establishing the equivalence between NN and a broad family of L2 regularized 
kernel machines (KMs) with finite-width bounds, which cannot be handled by prior work, and showing that every 
finite-width NN trained by such regularized loss functions is approximately a KM. 

Furthermore, we demonstrate our theory can enable three practical applications, including 
- *non-vacuous* generalization bound of NN via the corresponding KM; 
- *non-trivial* robustness certificate for the infinite-width NN (while existing robustness verification methods 
(e.g. IBP, Fast-Lin, CROWN) would provide vacuous bounds); 
- intrinsically more robust infinite-width NNs than those from previous kernel regression.  

See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06063.pdf) and [slides](http://chenyilan.net/files/SVM_Slides.pdf) for details.

### Robustness verification of NN
Add your paths to your NN models in the code and separate by the width. Specify the width of the models you want to verify.
Then run the `test()` function in `robust_svm.py`.
```
python -c "import robust_svm; robust_svm.test('nn')"
```

### Robustness verification of SVM
Add your paths to your SVM models in the code. Then run the `test()` function in `robust_svm.py`.
```
python -c "import robust_svm; robust_svm.test('svm')"
```
